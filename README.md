#**Task 2: Customer Retention**

A few weeks after you deliver your dashboard to management, the telecom's Retention Manager contacts you personally. He was thrilled with your work and requested if you might create a dashboard on client retention.

Furthermore, to better comprehend the data, the Telco Retention Manager has set a meeting with the engagement partner at PwC to discuss the following points:


-We do not want to lose our hard-earned customers in the telecom business.
-The retention department is here to get clients back in the case of termination.
-Currently, we get in touch after they have terminated the contract, but this is reactionary: it would be preferable to know who is at danger beforehand.
-We have done customer analysis with Excel, but it has always ended in a dead-end.
-We would want to learn more about our consumers. Visualised clearly so that it is self-explanatory for our management The Retentions Manager has supplied some information; please go to the resources section.
