# **Task 2: Customer Retention**

A few weeks after you deliver your dashboard to management, the telecom's Retention Manager contacts you personally. He was thrilled with your work and requested if you might create a dashboard on client retention.

Furthermore, to better comprehend the data, the Telco Retention Manager has set a meeting with the engagement partner at PwC to discuss the following points:


- We do not want to lose our hard-earned customers in the telecom business.
- The retention department is here to get clients back in the case of termination.
- Currently, we get in touch after they have terminated the contract, but this is reactionary: it would be preferable to know who is at danger beforehand.
- We have done customer analysis with Excel, but it has always ended in a dead-end.
- We would want to learn more about our consumers. Visualised clearly so that it is self-explanatory for our management The Retentions Manager has supplied some information; please go to the resources section.

 **Task 3: Diversity & Inclusion**
Human Resources at our telecom client is highly into diversity and inclusion. They’ve been working hard to improve gender balance at the executive management level, but they’re not seeing any progress. They’re reaching out to us for help.

At PwC Switzerland we are often approached by clients seeking support with diversity and inclusion. Companies need a workforce of diverse talents and backgrounds to succeed in an increasingly complex and heterogeneous world. To us, diversity and inclusion are business imperatives, not just nice-to-haves. We aim for all of our teams to feel welcome and appreciated. But actually achieving this and unlocking its potential involves a whole set of practical challenges.

Here is a hint: Calculating the following measures could help to define proper KPIs:

- number of men
- number of women
- number of leavers
- % employees promoted (FY21)
- % of women promoted
- % of hires men
- % of hires women
- % turnover
- Average performance rating: men
- Average Performance rating: women
